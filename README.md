     Create a folder with the project name and create the required HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as shown in the project structure.
      Now, use the HTML tags like textarea, button, div, head, body etc. to define the structure of the website.
       Add the styles to the HTML tags used to define the structure by selecting them with the help of given IDs and Classes.
       Utilise the speechSynthesis API of the global window object and the SpeechSynthesisUtterance to create a utteraance of the entered text.
       Next, use the speak() method of the speechSynthesis API to speak or play the created utterance as a speech.
      Handle the errors efficiently if user have not provided any text to convert.
